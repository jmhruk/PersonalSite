                    <p>Over the past couple of years I decided to get into some basic Robotics. I joined my school team and quickly ascended through the ranks. After spending my first season with the team in the VexIQ robotics competition as the programmer I decided to campaign for team leadership. As the Team Captain I decided to try and elevate my peers to find new strategies to win and I'm looking forward to a third season (second as captain) this year.</p>
