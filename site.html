                    <p>After using Python for over 2 years and taking CS in school, I've been able to quickly develop my Python skills from a novice coder to someone who is able to create excellent programs and learn new skills. Examples of my work in Python: Discord Bots using discord.py (Bots used in 3k+ Member discord servers), PyQt Gui Applications, CLI Applications and other various applications using APIs and Libraries.</p>

                    <p>I've been a Minecraft player for 8 years and this is the reason I learned Java. From learning Python I already had a decent understanding of programming languages, this allowed me to easily understand Java. By learning Java I was able to create my own Minecraft Servers (through Spigot Plugin Development) and even my own Minecraft Clients (through MCP).</p>

                    <p>After learning the previous two languages I have decided to pursue learning Web Development, in the past I have created some basic JS applications however nothing major. I have also created websites using platforms like Wix and WordPress. In the future I look forward to continuing my web development journey by learning new frameworks (like Bulma which this site is built on).</p>

                    <p>Over the past couple of years I decided to get into some basic Robotics. I joined my school team and quickly ascended through the ranks. After spending my first season with the team in the VexIQ robotics competition as the programmer I decided to campaign for team leadership. As the Team Captain I decided to try and elevate my peers to find new strategies to win and I'm looking forward to a third season (second as captain) this year.</p>
